# Video Comparison Modes Project
In this project, we hope to compare two video modes with regard to how effectively students perceive and learn information from an isntructor's lecture. One video mode, picture-in-picture, places the instructor in one box and the content (slides, blackboard) in another window. The other video mode, personified, overlays the instructor over the the content he or she is presenting. We collected survey responses from students and tried to determine in what aspects did one video mode perform better or worse than the other.

## Public version
This repository omits the CSV survey responses due to the need to protect the confidentiality of the survey respondents. If you would like a copy of the responses, please email [me](mailto:tklem2@illinois.edu) to be added as a contributor to the project.
